# coinstrenght
Coinstrenght shows you the strenght of coins compared to BTC on a 24hr timeframe.


Insert your Coinmarketcap API key in the "apikey" variable and you're good to go! The results will be shown in an output.txt file that will be created by the program.

I personally use this as a basis to trade on instead of scrolling the Coinmarketcap main page.
